# Data Types with post_content and post meta

`npm install` and `npm run dev-server`

### TODO

- [ ] Display template content on post creation (right now it's all placeholders)
- [ ] Default pattern for created CPT (i.e., render a default single.html content, also save a pattern)
- [ ] Document stuff better and show teammates
- [ ] Lock all content and styling except bound blocks's inside when entering data
- [ ] Work on examples that have a primary and secondary content
